### Hola ðŸ‘‹, I am Jair Medina
#### I am Jair Medina from Mexico :mexico:
I have a Petroleum engineering degree <class of 2020>, when I finished my PetE I realized how much I love automation, programming & data analysis so I've decided to enroll in the Electronics and Automation engineering program to enhance my skills and acumen as an engineer, currently a sophomore. 
I consider myself passionate about technology, data maps (fan of scrolling in reddit), and learning from data in every way possible, My native language is spanish, I consider myself fluent in english and currently at a basic level in German. 

I really enjoy studying and reading about:
- Economics :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Finance :dollar:
- Urban planning :house_with_garden:
- Philosophy :brain:
- Politics :classical_building: 
- And data analysis. :bar_chart:
